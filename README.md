## How to Run

Each subdirectory contains a test file with various test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementations. The projects are primarily written in C++, and Visual Studio 2022 with unit testing was used for development. The set up for the required framework in order to run the test cases is provided in the 'UnitTesting.pdf'.
