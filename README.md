# Data Structures Lab Tasks

This repository contains a collection of lab tasks and projects related to various data structures, implemented as part of my undergraduate coursework in Computer Science.

## Contents

- [Stacks](#stacks)
- [Queues](#queues)
- [Trees](#trees)
- [Graphs](#graphs)

## Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Implementation and basic operations.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Implementation and basic operations.

## Stacks

- **Stack Using Array**: Implementation and basic operations.
- **Stack Using Linked List**: Implementation and basic operations.

## Queues

- **Queue Using Array**: Implementation and basic operations.
- **Queue Using Linked List**: Implementation and basic operations.

## Trees

- **Binary Tree**: Implementation and traversal algorithms.
- **Binary Search Tree**: Implementation and basic operations.

## Graphs

- **Graph Representation**: Using adjacency matrix and list.
- **Graph Traversal**: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) implementations.

## How to Run

Each subdirectory contains a README file with specific instructions on how to compile and run the code examples. The projects are primarily written in [Programming Language], and you will need a compatible compiler or interpreter installed on your system.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional tasks related to data structures, feel free to fork this repository and open a pull request.
